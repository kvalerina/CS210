This project creates a program for the Corner Grocer to be able to analyze daily purchase records and help in optimizing the store layout based on item popularity. The program reads item names from a text file, counts each item's frequency, and provides several functionalities through a user-friendly interface. Users can search for a specific item's frequency, view all items with their frequencies, display a histogram of item frequencies, and exit the program. Additionally, it automatically creates a backup data file (frequency.dat) containing the item frequencies.

I think the use of a std::map to efficiently count item frequencies was done particularly well. This data structure enabled fast lookups and straightforward counting, making the program scalable and capable of handling larger sets of data. As well as, the program's user interface is clear and simple, allowing users to easily navigate through the options and access the information they need.

The program could be enhanced by adding functionality to update the item list in real-time, allowing the Corner Grocer to input new purchase records without restarting the program. Adding a more dynamic data structure or database could make this possible. Security measures could be implemented to ensure that the input file and backup file are not tampered with, potentially using file encryption or secure file access protocols.

Ensuring reliable data extraction and frequency counting from the text file posed the biggest challenge for the project. It was a little difficult because of the variety of item names and the requirement to accurately increase their quantities, especially when considering any differences in item naming or unintentional duplicates. I took the time to learn about C++ string manipulation and std::map operations in order to overcome this. Resources such as the C++ Standard Library documentation and online programming communities were useful for finding solutions to any challenges I faced.

This project enhanced my ability to process and analyze data from raw text files that could be used in fields like data science, finance, and any domain that relies on data-driven decision-making. Implementing a clear, user-friendly interface has enhanced my skills in designing applications. This understanding of UX principles can be directly applied to web development, application development, and any project aiming to enhance user engagement through ease of use.

The program was made maintainable by using clear naming conventions for variables and functions, making it easy for other developers to understand and modify the code. Functions were kept brief and focused on a single task, enhancing readability, and simplifying debugging. The design, with separate functions for each menu option and data processing task, makes the program adaptable. New functionalities can be added, or existing ones modified with minimal impact on the overall program structure.
